# Lists recap
* There's a difference between **Arrays** and **Lists**
* **Arrays** have a fixed size and only have read and write operations.
* **Lists** use an array internally that the user doesn't see.
* Programmers using Lists perceive that Lists grow and shrink.
* Lists include code that rearranges their elements as items are added and
  removed so no gaps are left in the internal array.
* The **List ADT** is an abstract idea of what a **List** should do.
* Different programming languages have different actual implementations
  of a **List**. You can compare their implementations against the **List
  ADT** specifiction to see how the implementation compares and differs.
* **Abstract Data Structures** allows programmers to discuss programming ideas
  independently of programming languages. JavaScript developers should be
  able to talk to Ruby, Python, C, C++, C# and Java developers and everyone
  should understand what a List generally is, even though all of the languages
  may implement their Lists slightly differently.
