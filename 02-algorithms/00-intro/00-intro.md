# Now - on to algorithms!

"Algorithm" might be a word you're familiar with, but check out this video to really see what we're referring to:

Algorithms are step by step instructions on how to solve a problem. Writing a recipe for a cake? That's an algorithm. Writing a function that calculates the tallest tree in the Amazon rainforest? Algorithm. Everything you write that walks someone or something step by step to accomplish a goal is an algorithm.

In computer science, there are many kinds of algorithms. However, there are a few big categories that people are generally referring to when they say 'algorithms'. These are searching, sorting, and complexity.

Making a chocolate cake sounds simple, but there are many different recipes you can follow to make a chocolate cake. Some are simple and quick, mixing everything in one bowl and throwing that in the oven. Others are complicated and time consuming, melting the vanilla and chocolate together over low heat while creaming the sugar and butter and timing the addition of the flour at the exact temperature. It's good to know each method - and it's better to know when to use one versus the other.

The same way, while we generally know the meaning of "search" and "sort", there are many ways to accomplish each objective, and each is of a varying complexity.

In this section, we're going to look into common algorithms and their complexity.
