Congratulations on completing this lesson! ðŸ’¥
========================================================

The materials this section covered will go a long way towards making you a better coder and software developer.


## What have we covered?


### Data Structures

A Data Structure is a way of storing and organizing data.

We learned about:

+ **List**: Used to store data in a linear and sequential manner. Works like an array, but dynamically sized.
  + Useful for generally holding data.
+ **Linked List**: Used to store data in a series of nodes. Insertion and deletion at any index is easy.
  + Because the nodes are connected with pointers, items do not need to be contiguous in memory.
+ **Set**: Like a list, except elements are always unique and duplicates are automatically removed.
  + Useful for holding email addresses, phone numbers, etc.
+ **Stack**: Stores data in LIFO (last-in first-out), fashion where the top-most element pops off first.
  + Useful for holding things like pancakes or, less excitingly, the call stack.
+ **Queue**: Stores data in FIFO(first-in first-out) fashion where the head element pops off first.
  + Useful for anything you want to access in a grocery store line style. "Head" is the bottom of the queue - the first thing that went in.
+ **Map**: Stores a set of key-value pairs. Insert many key-value pairs. Use the key to get the value.
  + Useful for anything where you want to associate a value with a key, such as dictionary words and database items.


### Algorithms

When we have a problem, we perform a series of steps to that helps us solve it. This is called an `Algorithm`, and it works very much like a recipe. Algorithms help us solve a large variety of problems reliably and repeatedly. We learned about:

+ **Sorting:** If we have a list of elements, and we want it ordered numerically, alphabetically, etc, we use a sorting algorithm to put the elements in order. We learned different algorithms that help us sort. Two big ones are bubble sort and merge sort.

  + Bubble sort works by comparing two elements at a time and swapping if necessary. It does this repeatedly until there are no elements left to swap. The runtime complexity of this algorithm is `O(n^2)`.

  + Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by splitting a list in half repeatedly until there is just one element in each piece. It then proceeds to merge the two results together and combine them.

+ **Searching:** If you have a list of elements and want to find a specific value, you would use a search algorithm.

  + We covered linear search, which goes through every element in the list from beginning to end until it finds (or doesn't find) the element.

  + We also covered binary search, which breaks the list in half each time it doesn't find a match. It does this by picking the element in the middle and going left or right depending on how it compares to the target.

## Why it this important?

### Interview Preparation

One of the primary motivations to this lesson is to better prepare you for interviews in software development. Whether you decide to become a full-stack, front-end, or back-end developer, the idea of algorithms and data structures is the same. In interviews, you will be asked questions that pertain to this; this lesson is designed to help you answer it.
> For example, some very common interview questions include reversing a linked list, finding common elements in arrays, and implementing merge sort).

### Programming Completeness

This section also makes you into a more complete programmer. Studying this lesson will give you a deeper understanding as to how systems work under the hood and insight into the thought behind their design.

> For example, as a web developer, you now have greater insight into how JavaScript is executed in the browser (with a call `Stack` of functions).

### Improved Problem Solving

Some of the questions and challenges you will face in your everyday programming life will be difficult. There is only one thing that will make you better at them: **repeated practice**.

You will inevitably encounter situations that will require you to solve unique problems. Problem solving is a learned skill and one that is essential as a programmer. You now have some tools to have a starting point and guide going into these.
