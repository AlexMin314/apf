# Interview thoughts!

If your goal after this class is to get a job, here are some thoughts for you to keep in mind when you're handed a programming problem.

A big thing in interviews - and in practicing for yourself - is whiteboarding problems, which is to say, drawing out pseudocode on a whiteboard and then writing the actual code to go with it.

An important thing to remember is to talk through what you're doing!

Other important things to remember:
* Clarify question using a sample input and output. This is a great time to note any edge cases you see and to make sure you understand the question correctly.
  * *"To confirm, if you were to give me the string 'apple', you would expect this function to return the object { 'a':1, 'p':2, 'l':1, 'e':1}? And if you were to give me a string like '! !', would you want that to output counts for all the characters ({'!':2, ' ':1}), or just the non-whitespace, or none of those since they aren't letters?"*


* Pseudocode so you and the interviewer can focus on logic first.
  * *"I'm going to start with pseudocode, and I can transition to JavaScript after."*

* Test your pseudocode with your sample input and output.

* Check in with your interviewer. They may have more edge cases for you to handle. They may ask you about runtime (Big O). They may just want you to move on to syntactically-correct code.

* Write syntactically-correct code. Take a second look at syntax after you finish a draft.

* Test your syntactically-correct code with your input and output.

* Your interviewer will often ask you about Big O at an earlier step. If youâ€™re feeling confident, though, now is a good time to offer.

* Make sure that you return the type that the interviewer asks for. It looks careless to return an array when the task asks for a string.
