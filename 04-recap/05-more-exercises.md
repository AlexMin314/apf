The first two questions you've seen already, and you've already done. The question is: Can you do it by yourself?

Remember to start at the least with pseudocode - even talking through it wins you points and can lead you to the right answers!

## Palindrome

Write a function that takes in one input, a String, and return true if it is a palindrome and false if it is not. Make your solution case-insensitive.

Remember, a palindrome is a word that is the same forwards and backwards.

Examples:
* Input: "racecar" Output: true
* Input: "Hannah" Output: true
* Input: "Blarg" Output: false
